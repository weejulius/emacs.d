* Deviant theme for Emacs 24

  Inspired by the color scheme previously used (the 2nd version?) by
  [[http://www.deviantart.com/][deviantart.com]].  Now they changed the theme to a much brighter one.
  This theme is for GNU Emacs version 24, in which theming is
  officially supported.

* Installation

Copy =Deviant-theme.el= to somewhere in your Emacs =load-path=.  Then
either =M-x load-theme<RET>Deviant= or =(load-theme 'Deviant t)=.

If you are using Emacs in Mac, and your Emacs is not patched for the
sRGB bug (see the remarks section), you need to set `dv-macp' to `t'
in order to have the correct color.

* Some Remarks

There is a [[http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug%3D8402][bug]] in Emacs under Mac OS X.  A color specification in hex
(e.g. =#2e3735=) is rendered in generic-RGB color space instead of the
correct sRGB.  Therefore a set of colors compensated for that is used
in this theme if the OS is Mac OS X.

UPDATE: Now there are patches that deal with this color bug.  In
Homebrew you can choose to apply that patch which is what I did.  So I
now hard-code the theme to use sRGB colors.
